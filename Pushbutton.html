            <h3> When the Button is pressed, it will turn on a red LED that will communicate to the user that their request is pending and will send a radio signal which will activate a slow calm melody that will communicate
          to the user that their request is pending in a different way of communication. This is important so that all people are able to use this traffic light effectively. Both the LED and the Calm sound will continue for 45 seconds and then
          the red LED will turn off and a white LED will turn on which will show the pedestrians that their request to cross has been granted and they may process. Just as the white LED shows pedestrains to cross, the changing of rythm
          shows individuals that it is safe to cross. This once again is so that a multitude of people can use this system for safety. After 30 seconds, the White Light and the audio will turn off, which stops the sequence. </h3>
